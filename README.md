### A scaffolding tool for spinning up a quick Golang backend/API for your side projects.

Klarah is a great option to get an http server up and running quickly with little overhead. Let it take
care of the initial load of writing your own server from scratch. With many options of frameworks and
databases to choose from, you can customize it to fit your use case.

As stated in the prior paragraph, customization is a plus when using Klarah to start your project's backend.
Start with the boilerplate that is generated, add more or take away from what's there. The key is that you can
do as much or as little as you want once your project has been generated.

To install Klarah:
```Install url goes here```

When installed Klarah creates a binary that attaches directly to your GOPATH, so you can use it whenever you 
need to reach for it.
